    The tiles cover the whole array; which will be additionally padded, to ensure that
    the section of the tile that contributes to the final image comes from the center
    of the tile.

    The method returns a generator that yields tuples of array and tile information,
    the latter includes whether the tile is the last one, the coordinates of the
    overlap crop, and the coordinates of the stitched tile.

    Input array should have shape SC(Z)YX, while the returned tiles have shape C(Z)YX,
    where C can be a singleton.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (S, C, (Z), Y, X).
    tile_size : 1D numpy.ndarray of tuple
        Tile sizes in each dimension, of length 2 or 3.
    overlaps : 1D numpy.ndarray of tuple
        Overlap values in each dimension, of length 2 or 3.
    padding_kwargs : dict, optional
        The arguments of `np.pad` after the first two arguments, `array` and
        `pad_width`. If not specified the default will be `{"mode": "reflect"}`. See

    Yields
    ------
