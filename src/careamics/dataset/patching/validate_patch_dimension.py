    """
    Check patch size and array compatibility.

    This method validates the patch sizes with respect to the array dimensions:

    - Patch must have two dimensions fewer than the array (S and C).
    - Patch sizes are smaller than the corresponding array dimensions.

    If one of these conditions is not met, a ValueError is raised.

    This method should be called after inputs have been resized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : np.ndarray
        Input array.
    patch_size : Union[List[int], Tuple[int, ...]]
        Size of the patches along each dimension of the array, except the first.
    is_3d_patch : bool
        Whether the patch is 3D or not.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the patch size is not consistent with the array shape (one more array
        dimension).
    ValueError
        If the patch size in Z is larger than the array dimension.
    ValueError
        If either of the patch sizes in X or Y is larger than the corresponding array
        dimension.
