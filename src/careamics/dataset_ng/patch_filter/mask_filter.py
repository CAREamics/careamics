        Minimum percentage of masked pixels required to keep a patch.

        Create a MaskPatchFilter.

        This filter removes patches who fall below a threshold of masked pixels
        percentage. The mask is expected to be a positive mask where masked pixels
        correspond to regions of interest.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask_extractor : PatchExtractor[GenericImageStack]
            The patch extractor for the mask used for filtering.
        coverage_perc : float
            Minimum percentage of masked pixels required to keep a patch. Must be
            between 0 and 1.
        p : float, default=1
            Probability of applying the filter to a patch. Must be between 0 and 1.
        seed : int | None, default=None
            Seed for the random number generator for reproducibility.
